     <h1>Haley Abrams</h1>
     <article>
       Born Fort Collins, Colorado, USA, 1993 2015 Bachelors in Fine Arts
       from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago Haley Abrams is a
       commercial photographer and videographer born and raised in Fort
       Collins, Colorado. She moved to Chicago in 2012 to attend The School
       of the Art Institute and will complete her Bachelors in Fine Arts in
       May of 2015. She combines her artistic eye with her talent for
       commercial-based shooting to create outstanding and unusual images.
       Her interest in photography was sparked at the young age of 12 years.
       A combination of community participation as well as enrollment in AP
       Art in high school aided in her admission to the School of the Art
       Institute of Chicago with a portfolio based merit scholarship. Since
       attendance at SAIC, she has focused her portfolio work primarily on
       commercial projects and portraiture. Her work intends to redefine the
       reputation of commercial photography by creating images that
       consciously reflect artistic techniques to create advertisements as
       high art. She focuses on shooting on location in exotic places as well
       as in the studio, incorporating sophisticated props and materials to
       create stunning images that go beyond traditional advertising.
